      "question": "What is the difference between logging and tracing?",
      "answer": "Logging captures discrete events within a single service, while tracing tracks requests across multiple services in a distributed system. Logs are useful for debugging individual components, whereas traces provide end-to-end visibility into request flows and help identify performance bottlenecks across service boundaries."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much overhead does distributed tracing add?",
      "answer": "With sampling enabled, distributed tracing typically adds 1-5% overhead to request latency. The impact depends on sampling rate, instrumentation libraries, and backend processing. Most teams start with 10% sampling in production to balance observability with performance."
